# Proof Verification Helper

An intelligent web application designed to assist mathematicians and computer scientists working with formal proof verification systems, particularly Lean 4. The application leverages AI and interactive visualization to help users understand, debug, and construct formal proofs more efficiently.

## Features

### Core Features

- **Interactive Proof Editor**: Write and edit Lean 4 code with syntax highlighting and real-time parsing
- **Proof Visualization**: Interactive dependency graphs showing theorem → lemma dependencies
- **AI-Powered Suggestions**: Get intelligent recommendations for lemmas, tactics, and proof steps
- **Proof Search**: Search and explore theorems from mathlib and your own proofs
- **Step-by-Step Proof Builder**: Build proofs incrementally with guided suggestions
- **Learning & Tutorials**: Interactive tutorials and example proofs
- **User Library**: Save and organize your proofs
- **Authentication**: User accounts with secure authentication

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- Monaco Editor for code editing
- Cytoscape.js for graph visualization
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Zustand for state management
- React Router for navigation

### Backend
- Node.js with TypeScript
- Express.js for REST API
- SQLite (better-sqlite3) for database
- JWT for authentication
- Intelligent rule-based AI suggestions (free, no API key required)

## Getting Started

### For Non-Technical Users (Easiest)

**Download the standalone application:**
- macOS: Download `.dmg` file, drag to Applications, and launch
- Windows: Download `.exe` installer, run and follow wizard
- Linux: Download `.AppImage`, make executable, and run

**That's it!** The app runs everything automatically - no configuration needed!

### For Developers

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm

#### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sathvikkurap/proof-verification-helper.git
cd proof-verification-helper
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm run install:all
```

3. Start the development servers:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start:
- Backend API on http://localhost:5000
- Frontend on http://localhost:3000

#### Building Standalone App

```bash
npm run build:app
```

This creates a standalone application in `electron/dist/`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in:
- `frontend/dist/` - Frontend build
- `backend/dist/` - Backend build

## Usage

### Creating a Proof

1. Navigate to the Editor page
2. Enter your Lean 4 code in the editor
3. The app will automatically parse and analyze your proof
4. View the dependency graph and AI suggestions
5. Save your proof (requires login)

### Using AI Suggestions

1. Create or open a proof
2. The suggestions panel will show AI-powered recommendations
3. Click the checkmark icon to apply a suggestion
4. Suggestions are ranked by confidence score

### Visualizing Proofs

1. Open a proof in the editor
2. The visualization panel shows the dependency graph
3. Click on nodes to see details
4. The graph is interactive - zoom and pan to explore

### Searching Theorems

1. Go to the Search page
2. Enter search terms or use filters
3. Browse results and click to view details

## Development

### Running Tests

(Add test commands when tests are added)

### Code Style

The project uses:
- ESLint for linting
- TypeScript for type checking
- Prettier (recommended) for formatting

## Configuration

### Database

The app uses SQLite by default. To use PostgreSQL:

1. Update `backend/src/db/index.ts` to use PostgreSQL
2. Update connection string in environment variables

### AI Suggestions

The application uses an **intelligent hybrid AI system**:

1. **Auto-Detects Ollama** (if installed):
   - Uses local LLM for better suggestions
   - 100% free, private, and offline
   - Automatically enabled if Ollama is running
   - No configuration needed!

2. **Rule-Based Fallback**:
   - Always works, even without Ollama
   - High-quality suggestions using Lean 4 knowledge base
   - Instant responses
   - Perfect for non-technical users

**For best results (optional):**
- Install Ollama: `brew install ollama` (or download from ollama.com)
- Pull a model: `ollama pull llama3.2`
- Start Ollama: `ollama serve`
- The app automatically detects and uses it!

**No configuration needed** - works great out of the box!
